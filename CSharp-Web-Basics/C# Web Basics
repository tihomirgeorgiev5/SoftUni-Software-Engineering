C# Web Basics course lays the foundation of important principles and instruments used in web development, such as HTTP Protocol, Cookies and Sessions in general and especially in ASP.NET Core web-development framework.

With the gathered knowledge we'll create our own web application with C# and MS SQL Server with separation of Models, Views and Controllers (MVC).
